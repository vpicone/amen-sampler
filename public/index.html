          <h2>About the Amen break</h2>
          <p>
            The Amen break is a drum break that has been widely sampled in
            popular music. It comes from the 1969 track "Amen, Brother" by the
            soul group the Winstons. The drum break lasts about seven seconds
            and was performed by <strong>Gregory Coleman</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the rise of hip hop in the 1980s, the break was widely sampled;
            in the 1990s, it became a staple of drum and bass and jungle music.
            It has been used on thousands of tracks of many genres, making it
            one of the most sampled recordings in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Winstons received no royalties for its use; bandleader Richard
            Lewis Spencer said it was unlikely Coleman,
            <strong>who died homeless and destitute in 2006</strong>, realized
            the impact he had made on music.
